# Detection of COVID-19 in posteroanterior X-Rays Images Using Deep Learning



The  novel  coronavirus  2019  (COVID-19)  expands over  the  world  has  implied  many  challenges  for  health  systems like  diagnostic  methods  acquisition  of  high  sensibility  and  low cost-benefit. Its impact is major in middle-low income countries, it affects extremely poor places.  On the other hand, the shortage of human potential in such areas leads to late diagnosis of patients. In  response  to  this  gap,  the  present  paper  through  Xception,VGG,  DarkNess,  (complete  models)  seeks  to  discern  chest  X-rays positive for COVID-19 from normal and other pathologies. Also, to provide a score for severity in case the radiographs are positive for COVID-19.




## 1. METHODOLOGY



## 1.1. Detection dataset

In this study, we used chest x-ray images obtained from several sources. Initially we collected x-ray images consider anteroposterior (AP) and posteroanterior (PA) projections, but for classification models only PA images were used. The new dataset that contains 12027 images between COVID-19, NORMAL and NO_COVID (Fig. 1), was divided into AP and PA projection.
